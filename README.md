kata
====

This is version 2 of the Poker Hand kata. It appwears to be TDD as 
opposed to DDD (if the two can be different). The very first test is to 
test whether the two hands are tied.

This is complete different to the first kata where comparing the two 
hands was left until much later in the process.

My fear on this one is that comparing the two opposing hands gets 
lost in the comparing of a players cards.

My gut feeling is the instantiation of the hand is where the focus 
should be, not the comparisons.At least I thinks thtas what the focus 
would be.
